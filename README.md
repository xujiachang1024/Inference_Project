# Statistical Inference Course Project
Course Project for Statistical Inference, part of Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins University on Coursera

### Part 1: Simulation Exercise

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

### Part 2: Inferential Analysis

In the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
